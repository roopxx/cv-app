# CV Maker - React + Vite Project

CV Maker is a mobile-friendly web application that allows users to create job-ready resumes instantly. Users can load a template, enter their personal information, educational qualifications, and professional experience to generate a professional resume. This project served me well as a great starting point for practicing React concepts, as it involved structuring the application into components and managing state using props. This project was part of Odin Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).

## Features

For this project, I have implemented the following features:

- **Load Template Button**: Users can load a pre-designed template for their resume.
- **Clear Template Button**: Option to clear the current template and start over.
- **Print Resume Button**: Users can print the generated resume for offline use.
- **Personal Information**: Section to input personal details such as first name, last name, email, phone number, and address.
- **Educational Qualification**: Section to add educational qualifications, including institution name, degree, and dates of study.
- **Professional Experience**: Section to add professional experience, including company name, position, dates of employment, and job responsibilities.
